Time series forecasting of telecom revenue using Auto-ARIMA and walk-forward validation.

📈 Telecom Revenue Forecasting with Auto-ARIMA

Overview:
This project focuses on forecasting daily telecom revenue using historical data.
A Time Series forecasting approach was applied using an Auto-ARIMA model, and the model's performance was evaluated through walk-forward validation.

The goal was to build an accurate model that can predict future revenue patterns — a critical tool for business decision-making.

📂 Project Structure:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Seasonal Decomposition

Stationarity Testing (ADF Test)

Auto-ARIMA modeling

Walk-forward validation

Performance evaluation


🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas — data manipulation

Matplotlib — visualization

pmdarima — Auto-ARIMA modeling

scikit-learn — metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)

statsmodels — time series decomposition and ADF test


📊 Results
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~0.60 million

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ~0.75 million

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): ~4.75%

The model consistently tracks the revenue patterns with high accuracy, making it a strong candidate for operational forecasting in telecom business environments.
