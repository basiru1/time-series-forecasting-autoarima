## Introduction

Time series forecasting is crucial for businesses, especially in the telecom sector, where understanding revenue trends can lead to better decision-making. This project employs the Auto-ARIMA model to predict future values based on historical data. The model automatically selects the best parameters, simplifying the forecasting process.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps outlined below. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine, along with the necessary libraries.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pmdarima`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pmdarima pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn
```

## Features

- **Auto-ARIMA**: Automatically selects the best ARIMA parameters.
- **Walk-Forward Validation**: Validates the model's performance on unseen data.
- **Data Visualization**: Plots to visualize the results and forecasted values.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed explanations of methodologies and code.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is derived from telecom revenue figures. Ensure that your data is in a time series format, with a date column and a revenue column. Hereâ€™s a sample of how your data should look:

| Date       | Revenue  |
|------------|----------|
| 2020-01-01 | 100000   |
| 2020-02-01 | 110000   |
| 2020-03-01 | 105000   |

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basiru1/time-series-forecasting-autoarima.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd time-series-forecasting-autoarima
```

## Usage

To run the forecasting model, execute the following script:

```bash
python forecast.py
```

This will generate the forecast and save the results in a specified output file. Make sure to modify the `forecast.py` script to point to your dataset.

## Walk-Forward Validation

Walk-forward validation is a robust technique for time series forecasting. It involves training the model on a subset of the data and testing it on the subsequent data points. This method helps in assessing the model's predictive performance in a realistic setting.

### Steps for Walk-Forward Validation

1. **Split the Data**: Divide your dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Train the Model**: Fit the Auto-ARIMA model on the training set.
3. **Make Predictions**: Forecast the next time point.
4. **Update the Training Set**: Add the new observation to the training set.
5. **Repeat**: Continue this process for the entire testing set.

## Results

The results of the forecasting can be visualized using plots. The generated graphs will show both the historical data and the forecasted values, allowing you to assess the accuracy of the model visually.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to visualize the results:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample plotting code
plt.plot(actual_data, label='Actual Revenue')
plt.plot(forecasted_data, label='Forecasted Revenue', linestyle='--')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
